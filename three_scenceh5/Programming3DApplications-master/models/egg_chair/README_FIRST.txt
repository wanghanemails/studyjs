Classic Egg Chair

There are many variations of "Egg Chairs" available; many out there are similar to this one too.  I decided to model this Egg Chair just to say I did it.  I think what separates mine from the vast majority is the small details.  I've included several things here, like seams, and high several high quality textures to add variety to your renders when you use this model.  This model was created by me in 3dsmax 2012.  The chair comes fully textured with it's own high resolution textures (color, reflection/specular, and bump), suitable for close-up rendering, but you are also free to apply your own procedural texture if you desire.

I have provided 3 distinct color maps for the seat, which you can swap out to fit the color situation of your renders as well.  The default is the brown leather.  you can use the same specular and bump maps with all of the color textures. You are free to use or modify these objects as you see fit, for use in your scenes as architectural props, home decor, or any other type of scene where you may need a quality chair. This model is free to use for both commercial and non commercial renders. You may not, however, resell these objects, or any derivative of these objects, individually or as part of a package/set.

*** OBJ users, the Poser OBJ version was exported with a scale conversion that should load with the appropriate scaling into most Poser 9 and PP2012 scenes if you remove all selections in the Wavefront OBJ Import Options dialogue box.  BE SURE, when importing the object into Poser, to DE-select all options boxes in the Import Options dialogue; Centered, Place on Floor, Percent of Standard Figure Size, etc.  NONE of these should be checked, and then the object should load on the floor with proper scale.

**** All textures were created by me, but most of the original reference textures were found at CGTextures.com texture resource website.***
